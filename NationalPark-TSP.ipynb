    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is one of the most famous problems in computer science. It analyzes the age-old question of determining optimal spatial paths between many locations (Hoffman et al., 2013). Specifically, the TSP asks: \n",
    "\n",
    "> Given a list of points and the distances between them, what is the shortest path that visits each city once and returns to the origin?\n",
    "\n",
    "The TSP is based on the historical traveling salesman of [Willy Loman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Loman) fame. Individuals traveled door-to-door, enticing residents to purchase Cutco knives, Tupperware, vaccuums, and the like. Salesmen like Willy had to carefully plan an efficient route from city to city--the shorter the route the better. \n",
    "\n",
    "This conundrum seduced computer scientists because of how computationally expensive it can be. To search for the optimal path for all possibilities among *n* points is more difficult the more points you have. In computer science, this is known as an O(n!) (or 'Big O') notation algorithm (Google Developers, 2015). Thus, an automation problem was born."

    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of the shortest distance between cities, this project will enable the user to find the shortest distances between any points with longitude and latitude values. In the example presented here, I use coordinates for U.S. National Parks scraped from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_areas_in_the_United_States_National_Park_System#National_parks), but you could substitute these with any web scraped points. Alternatively, you could skip the web scraping and provide a .csv with your points.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be thinking, *doesn't [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/) already do this?* The answer is yes, but only to a point (haha). Google Maps Directions API provides superb applications for  paths between [waypoints](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/intro#Waypoints), but limits the user to 23 such points. This leaves much to be desired if you have a long list of destinations you want to hit, like my epic National Park road trip. By inputting user-specified points with associated coordinate values, this project returns the optimal itinerant route via Euclidean distance, with possible expansion to driving distance and time (in progress)."

    "## Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "While the TSP is relatively easy to describe, it remains a delightful thought experiment because it is so computationally expensive to solve. Hoffman et al. (2013) describe the TSP as part of a larger group of problems that are known as [combinatorial optimization problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization). Specifically, the TSP is classified as *NP*-complete, meaning that if someone could write an efficient algorithm for the TSP, then all other *NP*-complete problems could also be solved with similarly efficient solutions (Hoffman et al., 2013).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Brute Force\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve an *NP*-complete problem by brute force isn't really feasible. [Mihailo Lalevic](http://www.digitalmihailo.com/traveling-salesman-problem-dynamic-algorithm-implementation-in-python/) wrote a Python script that shows the relationship between number of points and processing time; when you reach 22 points, the performance declines immensely because of memory usage (and takes over 10 minutes!). If I were to try to solve my National Parks problem by brute force, the number of permutations of possible routes is staggering: "

    "Fortunately, others have created computer programs and algorithms to make the TSP easy for amateurs like myself. Many solutions to the TSP reference [Christofides algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christofides_algorithm) (1976), which finds approximate solutions to the TSP based on instances where distances are symmetric and obey the triangle equality concept. This algorithm guarantees that its solutions will be within a factor of 1.5 of the optimal solution length.\n",

Concorde does this using branch-and-bound algorithms: \"when the algorithm branches out to search for the optimum, many of the permutations can actually be safely cut short if it is impossible for a branch to result in a value better than a known better solution\" (Mehyar, 2015). Mehyar has created a helpful example of the optimal driving path between [Tesla supercharger stations](http://mortada.net/the-traveling-tesla-salesman.html#Optimal-Path-for-Supercharger-Traveling), built with the Google Maps Directions API."

    "Before this project, web scraping data was a mystery to me, fit only for the most talented programmers. Enter: BeautifulSoup. This is a fantastic web scraping library that makes it easy to identify and parse your data from HTML source code. Note that for Mac, I had to enable the [Safari Web Inspector](https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Safari_Developer_Guide/Introduction/Introduction.html) to access the source code for a web page. I did have to scour the source code for tags that matched the coordinates I wanted, but the Web Inspector made it easy to identify which HTML tags to look for.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the record, your method of web scraping will change depending on the website you visit. Wikipedia HTML *tends* to be structured similarly between pages, but the tags you use and geospatial format of your points will change depending on the web page. For example, I can easily fetch latitude and longitude coordinates for the [tallest peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_highest_major_summits_of_the_United_States) in the U.S. using the method outlined below, but if I want to scrape [Peet's street addresses](http://www.peets.com/stores/peets-stores/stores-store-list.html) for a cup of coffee, the tags and geocoding will be different. (Note that some of the modules below require installation from the Terminal.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting the URL (and the source code) you want is a relatively simple affair. Getting the right spatial reference for your points (e.g., coordinates, addresses) is a different matter. Here I used the Wikipedia page for U.S. National Parks, imported the source code as text, and created a BeautifulSoup object that I can use to search for the information I want."

The function will step through a list of National Park names, match the name to the dataframe with latitude and longitude values, and calculate the distances. For example, it will begin with the first park (e.g., Acadia) and calculate the distances between Acadia and all other 43 parks. Next, it will then move onto the second park (e.g., Arches) and calculate the distances between Arches and all other 43 parks. And so on, until the end of the list is reached."

    "Here's the tricky part when the code is no longer, er, _technically_ reproducible. We are now ready to write our points to a file that can be used by the [Concorde](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde.html) TSP Solver. Recall that installing the program required some command line work, and also requires that you have a working C compiler. Before using Concorde, I had to install [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) for Mac and ensure that the command line tools package was downloaded. \n",
    "\n",
    "All that said, not everyone will have (or want to install) Concorde. Therefore, I've also included a Python script from Mihalo Lalevic's website that solves the TSP with a restricted number of points. Option 1 is the Concorde method, and Option 2 is the brute force method.\n",

This output is the `NODE_COORD_SECTION` of the file, and the number of nodes is the `DIMENSION` of the file. The resulting .tsp file is saved in my current directory."

Leaflet also enables you to use [background maps](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/index.html) from the awesome cartographers at [Stamen](http://stamen.com), [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/37.996/-100.876), and others.
